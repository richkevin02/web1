<h3>
  <p style="margin-top:15px;">There are enough rules in life as it is. Some, however, are there to help. Like the rules that govern how to dress well. Of course, every man or woman that has an opinion on such things speaks from personal experience – and no doubt what works for one doesn’t always work for another; or what works for one is considered too pedestrian or too avant-garde by another.</p> <p style="margin-top:15px;">So, when it comes to dressing, they always have to be taken at face value. They’re solid suggestions rather than the last word on style.</p>
